        "\n",
        "The Indian Penal Code (IPC) is the primary criminal law framework of India, containing numerous sections, definitions, and legal provisions. However, understanding and navigating the IPC can be challenging for students, legal professionals, and the general public due to its length, technical language, and complex structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "There is a need for an intelligent, user-friendly system that enables users to easily search, interpret, and understand IPC provisions without manually scanning through the entire document. Traditional keyword search methods are often insufficient for answering contextual or conversational queries related to specific sections, punishments, or legal terms.\n",
        "\n",
        "To address this challenge, the objective of this project is to develop an AI-powered chatbot that can interact with the official Indian Penal Code document. The chatbot should:\n",
        "\n",
        "Allow users to ask natural language questions about IPC sections and legal concepts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Retrieve relevant provisions from the IPC document.\n",
        "\n",
        "Provide clear, concise, and accurate explanations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Support multi-turn conversations for deeper understanding.\n",
        "\n",
        "The proposed solution aims to simplify access to legal knowledge and make the Indian Penal Code more approachable for students, lawyers, researchers, and citizens seeking legal information."
